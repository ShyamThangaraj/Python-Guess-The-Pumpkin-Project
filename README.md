## Introduction

This Python script uses the Turtle graphics library to create a pumpkin race game. The game involves three turtles, each represented by a pumpkin image, competing in a race. Users can make a guess on which pumpkin will win the race.

## Features

- Three pumpkins racing.
- User input to guess the winning pumpkin.
- Randomized wins and losses for each pumpkin.

## Usage

1. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python pumpkin_race.py
    ```

2. Follow the prompt to input your guess on which pumpkin will win.

3. Observe the pumpkin race simulation.

## Gameplay

The pumpkins will race multiple times, with each pumpkin having a chance to win or lose in each race. The user's guess will be compared to the actual winner after a specified number of races.

## Checking Results

The script will display the total wins for each pumpkin after the races are completed. It will also check if the user's guess matches the pumpkin with the most wins.
